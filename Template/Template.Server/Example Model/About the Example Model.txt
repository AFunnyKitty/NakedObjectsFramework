The Example Model folder contains a minimal domain model, consisting of
one domain entity class (Customer) which has only one user-modifiable
property (Name). There is a minimal service (CustomerRepository) for 
creating a new Customer or retrieving all Customers, and an ExampleDbContext
to auto-create a database using Entity Framework.

Two of these types are referenced in the NakedObjectsRunSettings, which
configures the application.

We recommend that when writing a real application you create your domain model(s)
in separate projects to the Run project. These model projects should not have
the Naked Objects framework packages installed, only the 
NakedObjects.ProgrammmingModel package.

Once you have started writing your own domain model, we suggest deleting
this whole directory, and references to its types.
