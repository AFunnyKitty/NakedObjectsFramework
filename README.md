The Master branch of this repository contains source for version 8 of the Naked Objects Framework (NOF8), which is currently at Beta stage.  The source code for the current stable release (NOF 7) is contained in the 7.0 branch of the repository. Note that both NOF7 and NOF8 can be used without cloning the repository, because both may be installed as NuGet packages from the public NuGet gallery - indeed that is the recommended approach.

NOF8
====

NOF8, currently at Beta stage, introduces a radically different user interface based on the Single Page Application (SPA) architecture. It uses identical domain model programming conventions as NOF7; indeed it is possible to run the NOF8 client and the NOF7 client alongside each other, as two different 'run' projects talking to the same domain model projects.

The best way to try NOF8 is to run the NakedObjects.Template application, which may be downloaded as a .zip file from: 

The draft developer manual for NOF 8 is available here: .


Getting Started
===============

There is a comprehensive Developer Manual for the Naked Objects Framework, available as a .docx:

For Release 7.0

At the start of the manual, under 'Writing your first Naked Objects application' is a very simple worked example.
