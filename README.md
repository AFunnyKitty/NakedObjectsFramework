NakedObjectsFramework
=====================

The Master branch of this repository contains source for version 8 of the Naked Objects Framework (NOF8), which is currently at Beta stage. Note that both NOF7 and NOF8 can be used without cloning the repository, because both may be installed as NuGet packages from the public NuGet gallery - indeed that is the recommended approach.

NOF8
====

NOF8, currently at Beta stage, introduces a radically different user interface based on the Single Page Application (SPA) architecture. It uses identical domain model programming conventions as NOF7; indeed it is possible to run the NOF8 client and the NOF7 client alongside each other, as two different 'run' projects talking to the same domain model projects.

The best way to try NOF8 is to run the NakedObjects.Template application, which may be downloaded as a .zip file from: https://github.com/NakedObjectsGroup/NakedObjectsFramework/blob/master/Run/NakedObjects.Template.zip 

The developer manual for NOF 8 is available here: .

When searching the NuGet package gallery for new releases of NOF8 (which are quite frequent at present) please ensure you have the 'include pre-releases' checkbox selected.

NOF8 source code is held in the master branch of this repository.

NOF7
====

NOF7 packages are available on the NuGet public gallery as stable releases.

NOF7 source code is available on the 7.0 branch of this repository.
